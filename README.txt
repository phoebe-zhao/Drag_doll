can manipulate the doll by rotating each components around its relative pivot.
rotate work correctly for children directly connected to torso such as uparms, uplegs and head. But if these objects rotate, their children's rotation doesn't work correctly. 
so to test the children's rotation, can't rotate their parents whiling testing. 

I set the scaling factor from 0.5 to 3.
